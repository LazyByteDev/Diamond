This DLL I developed was part of an experiment with the Minecraft Dungeons 2019 dev build. Please note that no official SDK or build is available with this source code. This project was based on reverse engineering the game and experimenting with the different parts of the game. This is mainly to get some insight into how the game worked.


This repo will not be updated but I will be remaking this source. Along with that, this source is very messy because it was intended to just test different functions in the game.
